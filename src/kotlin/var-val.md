# `var` vs. `val` - Difference

Source: <https://www.kotlintutorialblog.com/kotlin-var-vs-val/>

* `var`: **Mutable**. Used to declare a mutable variable. It means the value of variable can be changed multiple times.
* `val`: **Immutable** Used to declare a read only variable. It means once the value is assigned to variable, that canâ€™t be changed later.

`val` is same as `final` in Java.
